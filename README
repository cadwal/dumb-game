This is the sample game for DUMB, a Doom-like 3D game engine.  You can
read more about DUMB at http://samba.anu.edu.au/dumb/.

Currently, there's only one level, a few rooms, no monsters, no exit.
Hopefully this will evolve into something better.  If it does, we'll
also have to find a real name for it, as "the DUMB game" sounds
rather... dumb.

To be able to build this, you must first install:
- DUMB 0.13.3 (Due to different ptcomp parameters, 0.13.1 will not work.)
- netpbm
- GNU make.
- a C++ compiler, because we need the preprocessor.

So, if you just downloaded DUMB and this game, you'll first have to
install DUMB.  Then come back and configure and install this.
